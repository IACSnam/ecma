Fixed typo and got background drawn
Built logic of levelConstructor for block properties
Started initializing image loader

--Changes--
Spawned some dirt (for some reason, the grass isn't spawing)
Another weird note: the background doesn't draw properly; may be an issue with the canvas positioning

--To-do--
Spawn all the sprites and drawings (level constructor)

For some reason, I can't draw a background
