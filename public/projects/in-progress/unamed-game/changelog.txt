[5-20-20]
Fixed issue where coins and endpoint did not seem to spawn
Made death conditions and win condition (mob still not perfect)

[5-8-20]
Added rudimentary sidescrolling along the x axis (need to fix the mobs and scrolling on the y axis) 

[5-3-20]
I tried to fix gravity. A lot of problems came up so I undid all the work for today.

[5-2-20]
Added side collision detection on blocks so player doesn't ghost them when they fall. (The code that stops the player from sinking interferes with it though so I need to fix it)

[4-30-20]
Got smoother movement by removing the x_vel = 0 in the update of the player object by adding a keyUp handler (thanks Pierre)

[4-28-20]
Fixed issues with jumping animation

[4-22-20]
No longer extending classes
Added listeners on all objects that relate to the player

[4-13-20]
--Changes--
Changed Enemy class to GameObject class
Mobs now draw and animate properly
Coins and end spawn properly
Created player

[4-11-20]
--Changes--
Worked on mobs
Extended Sprite class to Enemy class to add velocity
Drew some mobs (still not drawing exactly where they need to be, but at least they draw)

[4-10-20]
--Changes--
Spawned some blocks
Another weird note: the background doesn't draw properly; may be an issue with the canvas positioning
Changed format of properties of blocks

[4-9-20]
--Changes--
Fixed typo and got background drawn
Built logic of levelConstructor for block properties
Started initializing image loader
